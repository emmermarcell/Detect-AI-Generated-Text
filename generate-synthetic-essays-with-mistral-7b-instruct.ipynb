Therefore, it is of grave importance to augment this data and increase the number of LLM-generated essays. The are quite a lot of already well-made datasets that have tackled this problem, the most successful is the [DAIGT V2 Train Dataset][1].\n\nSimply using this dataset would suffice in training our model of choice but then we haven't done any work in data preparation. So to make our contribution to the training data and broaden our knowledge of LLMs, we will use a [causal language model][2] to generate essays and append them to the previously mentioned dataset. These LLMs are able to predict the next token in a sequence of tokens.\n\nOur model of choice is the [`mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1`][3] since it outperforms the [`meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf`][7] model on all tested bencmarks based on the authors claim.\n\nThis notebook heavily sourced [binga's solution to generating essays][4] and even a bit by [Ertuğrul Demir's notebook][5] in terms of its structure method of grading students. The grading is based on the [PERSUADE corpus][6].\n\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset/versions/2\n[2]: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/language_modeling\n[3]: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1\n[4]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/phanisrikanth/generate-synthetic-essays-with-mistral-7b-instruct\n[5]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/datafan07/use-gemini-to-create-student-essays\n[6]: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1075293522000630\n[7]: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf?library=true","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load Model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import libraries\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\n\n# Define the path to the pre-trained model\nmodel_path = 'mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1'\n\n# Load the tokenizer and the model\n# The tokenizer prepares input text for the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)\n\n# Initialize the causal language model\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_path,\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,  #

Dear Senator [Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well. In recent years, the topic of the electoral college has been hotly debated, and there has been a growing call to abolish it in favor of a popular vote system for the presidency. I would like to take this opportunity to express my point of view on the matter and argue in favor of keeping the electoral college.\n\nFirstly, it is important to understand the role of the electoral college. The Electoral College is a system that was established by the founding fathers of the United States in order to give each state's population a proportionate say in the election of the president. Under this system, each state is allocated a certain number of electoral votes based on its population. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a given state receives all of that state's electoral votes.\n\nOne of the reasons that the electoral college was put in place was to prevent a candidate from winning the presidency simply by winning in densely populated urban areas. This system ensured that the candidate who won nationwide, not just in one or two large cities, would be the president. This was particularly important in the early days of the United States when the population was more evenly distributed across the country.\n\nHowever, it is also important to recognize that the electoral college has limitations. One of the biggest criticisms of the system is that it can sometimes result in a candidate ignoring certain states and focusing their efforts solely on others. This is because the candidate only needs to win the states with the highest number of electoral votes, so they may choose to focus their resources on those states rather than campaigning in others.\n\nAnother argument against the electoral college is that it can be undemocratic. After all, the popular vote is a direct measure of the will of the people, while the electoral college is a compromise system that does not always reflect the will of the majority. However, it is important to remember that the electoral college was put in place to prevent a candidate from winning by simply winning in densely populated urban areas, which would not accurately reflect the will of the entire country.\n\nFurthermore, some argue that a popular vote system would lead to a candidate focusing on only a few large cities, ignoring the needs and interests of rural areas. Under a popular vote system, a candidate may only need to win in a handful of large cities to win the election, while ignoring the needs and interests of smaller towns and rural areas. By contrast, the electoral college ensures that a candidate must win the support of voters across the country, including those in rural areas, in order to secure their vote.\n\nFinally, it is important to consider the stability of the country. The current electoral college system has been in place for over two centuries, and it has helped to maintain stability and continuity in our political system. Changing the system could have unpredictable consequences, and it may be unwise to make significant changes to such an established system without fully understanding the potential consequences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the electoral college does have limitations, it is ultimately a system that works to ensures a president who is representative of the entire country, not just densely populated urban areas. The system is particularly important in helping to maintain stability and continuity in our political system. Therefore, I strongly support the Electoral College and believe that it should be kept as the current method of electing the president of the United States.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Combine our generated essays with the DAIGT V2 Train Dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load in the DAIGT V2 Train Dataset\ndaigt_dataset = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/daigt-v2-train-dataset/train_v2_drcat_02.csv')\n\n# Combine the two datasets\naumented_dataset = pd.concat([llm_essays, daigt_dataset], ignore_index=True)\n\n# Save the result\naumented_dataset.to_csv('daigt-v2-train-dataset-augmented', index=False)\naumented_dataset","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-17T19:05:56.536958Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-17T19:05:56.537244Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-17T19:06:03.239094Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-17T19:05:56.537219Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-17T19:06:03.238166Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                                    text  label  \\\n0       Dear Senator [Name],\\n\\nI hope this message f...      1   \n1       Dear Senator [Name],\\n\\nI am writing to expre...      1   \n2       Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to express my v...      1   \n3       The electoral college is a group of electors ...      1   \n4       The cowboy's boots clanked against the wooden...      1   \n...                                                  ...    ...   \n45263  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n45264  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n45265  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n45266  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n45267  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n\n                            prompt_name                              source  \\\n0      Does the electoral college work?
