Therefore, it is of grave importance to augment this data and increase the number of LLM-generated essays. The are quite a lot of already well-made datasets that have tackled this problem, the most successful is the [DAIGT V2 Train Dataset][1].\n\nSimply using this dataset would suffice in training our model of choice but then we haven't done any work in data preparation. So to make our contribution to the training data and broaden our knowledge of LLMs, we will use a [causal language model][2] to generate essays and append them to the previously mentioned dataset. These LLMs are able to predict the next token in a sequence of tokens.\n\nOur model of choice is the [`Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1`][3] since it outperforms the  Llama 2 13B model on all tested bencmarks, based on the authors claim.\n\nThis notebook heavily sourced [binga's solution to generating essays][4] and even a bit by [Ertuğrul Demir's notebook][5] in terms of its structure.\n\n\n[1]: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset/versions/2\n[2]: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/language_modeling\n[3]: https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1\n[4]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/phanisrikanth/generate-synthetic-essays-with-mistral-7b-instruct\n[5]: https://www.kaggle.com/code/datafan07/use-gemini-to-create-student-essays","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load Model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import libraries\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\n\n# Define the path to the pre-trained model\nmodel_path = \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1\"\n\n# Load the tokenizer and the model\n# The tokenizer prepares input text for the model\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)\n\n# Initialize the causal language model\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    model_path,\n    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,  #

Car-free cities have become an increasingly popular concept in recent years as people become more environmentally conscious and aware of the damage that cars can do to our cities. This essay will explore the many advantages of limiting car usage in cities and argue for the implementation of car-free city policies.\n\nFirst and foremost, car-free cities would prioritize public transportation, walking, and cycling, which would lead to a reduction in air pollution. Cars are one of the major contributors to air pollution, as they emit significant amounts of harmful chemicals and gases into the atmosphere. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities could significantly decrease air pollution levels, leading to a healthier environment for citizens. Additionally, a decrease in air pollution would reduce the amount of money spent on healthcare due to respiratory illnesses.\n\nSecondly, car-free cities would promote physical activity and lead to a healthier population. Cars are a sedentary form of transportation, and by reducing their use, citizens would be encouraged to walk or cycle short distances, leading to increased physical activity. This can lead to a number of health benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health and reduced risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity.\n\nFurthermore, car-free cities would reduce traffic congestion and increase the availability of public space. Traffic congestion is a major problem in many cities, leading to longer commute times, increased stress levels, and decreased productivity. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities could dramatically reduce traffic congestion, leading to a safer and more livable environment. Additionally, increased public space could be utilized for parks, public art, and other community-based activities, leading to a more engaged and connected citizenry.\n\nAnother benefit of car-free cities is the potential for greater economic growth. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities could focus on developing alternative forms of transportation and infrastructure, leading to increased job opportunities in these fields. Additionally, reduced traffic congestion could lead to increased productivity and economic growth in the transportation sector, as businesses would be able to transport goods and services more efficiently.\n\nFinally, car-free cities would promote sustainability and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Cars are one of the most carbon-intensive forms of transportation, and their use contributes significantly to climate change. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities could significantly decrease their carbon footprint and promote sustainability. Additionally, reduced reliance on fossil fuels would decrease oil consumption and decrease the risk of geopolitical instability caused by conflicts over oil resources.\n\nIn conclusion, car-free cities offer a number of advantages that should be seriously considered. They would promote healthier living, reduce air pollution, reduce traffic congestion, promote economic growth and sustainability, and increase the availability of public space. While the implementation of such policies would require significant investment and planning, the long-term benefits for citizens and the environment make it a worthwhile endeavor. It is important that cities consider the potential of car-free policies in order to create more sustainable and livable environments for future generations.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Combine our generated essays with the DAIGT V2 Train Dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load in the DAIGT V2 Train Dataset\ndaigt_dataset = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/daigt-v2-train-dataset/train_v2_drcat_02.csv')\n\n# Combine the two datasets\naumented_dataset = pd.concat([llm_essays, daigt_dataset], ignore_index=True)\n\n# Save the result\naumented_dataset.to_csv('daigt-v2-train-dataset-augmented', index=False)\n\naumented_dataset","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-16T19:41:34.202237Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-16T19:41:34.202738Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-16T19:41:40.165829Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-16T19:41:34.202700Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-16T19:41:40.164722Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"execution_count":11,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                                    text  label  \\\n0       Car-free cities have become an increasingly p...      1   \n1       Cities around the world are growing in popula...      1   \n2       Car-free cities have been a topic for discuss...      1   \n3       Dear State Senator,\\n\\nThe topic of the Elect...      1   \n4       Dear [State Senator’s Name],\\n\\nFirstly, I wa...      1   \n...                                                  ...    ...   \n44884  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n44885  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n44886  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n44887  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n44888  Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to ...      1   \n\n                            prompt_name                    source  \\\n0                       Car-free cities  Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1   \n1                       Car-free cities  Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1   \n2                       Car-free cities  Mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1   \n3      Does the electoral college work?
